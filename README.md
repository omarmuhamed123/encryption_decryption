### This standard specifies the Rijndael algorithm ([3] and [4]), a symmetric block cipher that can 
### process data blocks of 128 bits, using cipher keys with lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits. 
### Rijndael was designed to handle additional block sizes and key lengths, however they are not 
### adopted in this standard. 
### Throughout the remainder of this standard, the algorithm specified herein will be referred to as 
### “the AES algorithm.” The algorithm may be used with the three different key lengths indicated 
### above, and therefore these different “flavors” may be referred to as “AES-128”, “AES-192”, and 
### “AES-256”.
